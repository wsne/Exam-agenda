\emph{Q10: What are the benefits of data aggregation? What are the challenges
of data aggregation in sensor networks?}

\section{Data-aggregation}

\subsection{Pros}

Energy and memory efficient

Reduce traffic load

Network congestion

Scalable to arge numbers of sinks and motes

Sending is expensive - computation is cheep

-To send 1kB 100 m uses the same energy as doing 3 million calculations.

Save energy and increase network lifetime

\subsection{Trade offs}

Accuracy 

Making robust estimations

single outlier reading can damage MAX/MIN aggregates

\subsection{Algorithms}
Optimal Data Aggregation is NP-Hard

Sub-optimal Algorithms:
\begin{description}
	\item[Opportunistic] Just aggregate when possible
	\item[Center at Nearest Source (CNS)] The nearest source acts as the
		aggregation point
	\item[Shortest Paths Tree (SPT)] Sources send using shortest path if able
		to aggregate
	\item[Greedy Incremental Tree (GIT)] Recursively select the closest source
		to the tree
	\item[Clustered Diffusion with Dynamic Data Aggregation] Hybrid between
		diffusion and clustering with the ability to aggregate data at the
		cluster heads
\end{description}
