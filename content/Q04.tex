\emph{Q4: What are the optimization goals of WSN? What are the basic design
principles in WSN? Give one or two examples which can reflect the design
principles.}

\section{Optimization goals}

\subsection{Quality of Service}
Different from traditional wireless networks

\begin{description}
	\item Event detection/reporting probability
	\item Event classification error
	\item Event detection delay
	\item Probability of missing a periodic report
	\item Approximation accuracy
	\item Tracking accuracy
\end{description}


\subsection{Energy Efficiency}
\begin{description}
	\item Energy per correctly received bit
	\item Energy per reported (unique) event
	\item Delay/energy tradeoffs
	\item Network lifetime
\end{description}

\subsection{Scalability}
The ability to maintain performance characteristics irrespective of the size of
the network

Consider actual application needs before looking for solutions!

\subsection{Robustness}
\begin{description}
	\item Failure of some nodes
	\item Environment changes
	\item Radio links change
\end{description}


\section{Design Principles}

\subsection{Distributed Organization}
Centralized approach hinders robustness and scalability
\\
Limited centralized -> Elect coordination
\subsection{In-Network processing}
Manipulate or process the data in the network
\\
Aggregation functions: minimum, maximum, average, sum..
\\
Take decisions
\begin{description}
	\item where to aggregate
	\item long to wait
\end{description}

\subsection{Adaptive fidelity and accuracy}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Event detection
		\begin{itemize}
			\item rarely send short ``all is well''
		\end{itemize}
	\item Temperature monitoring
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data-centricity}
Redundantly deployed sensor networks
\\
Focus on data directly instead of senders and transmitters.

\subsection{Exploit}
\subsubsection{Exploit location information}
\subsubsection{Exploit activity patterns}
\subsubsection{Exploit heterogeneity}

Deploy different types of nodes
\\
Asymmetric assignment of task
