\emph{Q9: Explain how directed diffusion works? What is the difference between
directed diffusion and SPIN?}

\section{SPIN}
\emph{Sensor Protocol for Information via Negotiation}

\subsection{ADV – data advertisement}
Node that has data to share can advertise this by transmitting an ADV with
meta-data attached

\subsection{REQ – request for data}
Node sends a request when it wishes to receive some actual data

\subsection{DATA – data message}

\begin{description}
	\item Contains actual sensor data with a meta-data header
	\item Usually much bigger than ADV or REQ messages
\end{description}


\section{Directed Diffusion}
\begin{description}
	\item Naming Scheme
	\item Interests
	\item Gradients
	\item Reinforcement
\end{description}

\section{Comparation}

\begin{description}
	\item SPIN is push
	\item Directed Diffusion is pull
\end{description}
